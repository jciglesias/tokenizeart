## 4. Technical Architecture

### 4.1 System Overview
```
┌─────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐
│   Web Frontend  │    │  Smart Contract │    │  IPFS Network   │
│   (Streamlit)   │◄──►│  (NEAR Chain)   │◄──►│   (Storage)     │
└─────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘
         │                       │                       │
         │              ┌─────────────────┐              │
         └─────────────►│ NEAR Wallet API │◄─────────────┘
                        └─────────────────┘
```

### 4.2 Technology Stack
- **Blockchain**: NEAR Protocol
- **Smart Contract**: Python (near-sdk-py)
- **Frontend**: Streamlit + Python
- **Storage**: IPFS (InterPlanetary File System)
- **Authentication**: Google OAuth + NEAR Wallet
- **Containerization**: Docker + Docker Compose

### 4.3 Data Flow
1. **Artist uploads artwork** → Frontend application
2. **File stored on IPFS** → Returns content hash (CID)
3. **Metadata created** → Including IPFS hash and artist information
4. **Smart contract called** → Mint NFT with metadata
5. **Transaction confirmed** → NFT ownership recorded on blockchain

---

## 5. Smart Contract Design

### 5.1 Core Functions

#### 5.1.1 NFT Minting
```python
@call
def nft_mint(self, token_id: str, metadata: dict, receiver_id: str):
    # Validates token uniqueness
    # Stores metadata on-chain
    # Assigns ownership to receiver
```

#### 5.1.2 Ownership Verification
```python
@view
def nft_token(self, token_id: str):
    # Returns token metadata and owner information
    # Enables ownership verification
```

#### 5.1.3 Marketplace Functions
```python
@call
def nft_approve_for_sale(self, token_id: str, price: int):
    # Allows owners to list NFTs for sale
    # Sets price and marketplace availability
```

### 5.2 Security Features
- **Access Control**: Only token owners can approve sales
- **Deposit Validation**: Ensures sufficient payment for purchases
- **Existence Checks**: Prevents operations on non-existent tokens
- **Predecessor Validation**: Verifies transaction sender identity

### 5.3 Data Structures
```python
Token Structure:
{
    "owner_id": "account.near",
    "metadata": {
        "title": "Artwork Title with 42",
        "description": "Detailed description",
        "media": "ipfs://hash",
        "media_hash": "ipfs_hash",
        "artist": "creator@email.com",
        "copies": 1
    }
}
```
