# TokenizeArt - NFT Project

## Overview
TokenizeArt is a Web3 NFT (Non-Fungible Token) project that allows users to create, mint, and manage digital art tokens on the blockchain. This project demonstrates the complete NFT lifecycle from creation to deployment and minting.

## Blockchain Platform Choice

### Why NEAR Protocol?
I chose NEAR Protocol over other blockchain platforms for the following reasons:

1. **Developer-Friendly**: NEAR provides excellent developer tools and documentation
2. **Low Transaction Costs**: Extremely low gas fees compared to Ethereum or BSC
3. **Fast Transactions**: Near-instant transaction finality
4. **Environmental Sustainability**: Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism
5. **User Experience**: Human-readable account names and easy wallet integration
6. **Scalability**: Sharding technology for high throughput

While the subject mentions BNB Chain, NEAR Protocol offers superior developer experience and lower costs for NFT operations, making it ideal for this educational project.

## Project Architecture

### Components
- **Smart Contract** (`code/nft/contract.py`): NEAR Protocol NFT contract written in Python
- **Web Application** (`app/`): Streamlit-based frontend for user interaction
- **IPFS Integration**: Decentralized storage for NFT metadata and images
- **Wallet Integration**: NEAR wallet connectivity for seamless transactions

### Technology Stack
- **Blockchain**: NEAR Protocol
- **Smart Contract Language**: Python (near-sdk-py)
- **Frontend**: Streamlit + Python
- **Storage**: IPFS (InterPlanetary File System)
- **Containerization**: Docker + Docker Compose

## NFT Standard Compliance

The project implements NFT functionality following NEAR's NFT standards:
- **Token Creation**: Unique token IDs with metadata
- **Ownership Management**: Track and verify token ownership
- **Transfer Functionality**: Secure token transfers between accounts
- **Metadata Standards**: JSON metadata with title, description, and media

## Security Features

### Ownership Verification
- `nft_token()` function to verify token ownership
- Predecessor account validation for sensitive operations
- Token existence checks before operations

### Access Control
- Only token owners can approve tokens for sale
- Deposit validation for purchases
- Proper storage key management

## Features

### Core NFT Functions
- **Minting**: Create new NFTs with custom metadata
- **Viewing**: Display owned NFTs with metadata
- **Trading**: Buy/sell functionality with price setting
- **Ownership**: Track and verify token ownership

### Web Interface
- **User Authentication**: Google OAuth integration
- **Wallet Management**: NEAR wallet connection
- **File Upload**: Direct IPFS upload interface
- **NFT Gallery**: Display owned tokens

- **Title**: Must include "42" and descriptive title
- **Description**: Token description
- **Media**: IPFS hash of the image
- **Media Hash**: Verification hash

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose
- NEAR CLI (for contract deployment)
- Python 3.11+

### Quick Start
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd tokenizeart

# Start services
docker-compose up -d

# Access application
open http://localhost:8501
```

### Manual Setup
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r app/requirements.txt

# Start IPFS node
ipfs daemon

# Run application
streamlit run app/tokenizeart.py
```

## Contract Deployment

### Testnet Deployment
The contract has been deployed on NEAR testnet:
- **Contract Account**: `tokenizeart.testnet`
- **Network**: NEAR Testnet
- **Explorer**: https://testnet.nearblocks.io/

### Deployment Process
1. ✅ Built contract using near-sdk-py
2. ✅ Deployed to NEAR testnet
3. ✅ Initialized contract with owner account
4. ✅ Verified deployment and functionality

## Usage Guide

### For Artists
1. **Login**: Authenticate with Google
2. **Connect Wallet**: Link NEAR wallet
3. **Upload Art**: Upload image file (must include "42")
4. **Mint NFT**: Create token with metadata
5. **View Collection**: Browse owned NFTs

### For Collectors
1. **Browse**: View available NFTs
2. **Purchase**: Buy NFTs from other users
3. **Verify**: Check ownership and authenticity
4. **Transfer**: Send NFTs to other accounts
